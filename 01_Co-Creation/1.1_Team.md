## 1.1 Team Roles and Responsibilities

For a project to be successful, the project staff must work well together. For this it is necessary to optimally fill the project team.
Our team consists of 5 people, who are task-oriented and should work together.
In the first step, we defined which roles we need for the project. In the second step we decided which person in the team takes over which role.
