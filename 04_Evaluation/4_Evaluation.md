# 4. Evaluation
## 4.1 Validation
### Observations in #1 Iteration

**Phase 1)**

The users either scan the QR code either directly when they come to the washing machine and interact with the smartphone 
or they only use the tablet. They do not understand why they need the smartphone for doing their laundry. 

**Phase 2)**

Users that use their smartphone immediately focus on the mobile application without taking note of the washing machine's display. 
Many probands choose their program on the tablet and change the settings via the display. Therefore, they do not understand why to use the smartphone. 
Many probands change the program settings on the machine's display and on the smartphone and expect that the settings are not applied when choosing an option on one of the displays. 
Additionally, many users search the start button on the tablet, because they are not using their smartphone for selecting the program. After a while of searching the start button, the probands that may be the QR code might help. However, this media break confuses when focusing on the washing machine's display.

**Phase 3)**

Some probands react positive on the expiration of the timer, others do not see the notification immediately.

### Observations in #2 Iteration

**Phase 1)**

Most of the probands are focused on the washing machine's display. 
The probands usually try to change the settings on this display. 

After one of the probands has changed settings on the tablet and changed the QR code with the smartphone, he is focused on his smartphone.   
Another test person changes the settings again via smartphone and observes the transferred changes on the tablet.
The hint on the tablet that you should either scan to the payment machine or the QR code is helpful for switching from the tablet to the smartphone. The test persons understand that the QR code is to be scanned and then the washing process is to be started via the app. 

**Phase 2)**

The test persons choose their desired program directly at the washing machine. 
However, the three standard programs on the smartphone usually cause confusion. 

**Phase 3)**

The test persons observe the timer and notice the notification on the smartphone.
