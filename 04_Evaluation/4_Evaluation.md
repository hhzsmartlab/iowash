# 4. Evaluation
## 4.1 Validation
**Observations in #1 Iteration**

**Phase 1)**
The users either scan the QR code either directly when they come to the washing machine and interact with the smartphone 
or they only use the tablet. They do not understand why they need the smartphone for doing their laundry. 

**Phase 2)**

Users that use their smartphone immediately focus on the mobile application without taking note of the washing machine's display. 
Many probands choose their program on the tablet and change the settings via the display. Therefore, they do not understand why to use the smartphone. 
Many probands change the program settings on the machine's display and on the smartphone and expect that the settings are not applied when choosing an option on one of the displays. 
Additionally, many users search the start button on the tablet, because they are not using their smartphone for selecting the program. After a while of searching the start button, the probands that may be the QR code might help. However, this media break confuses when focusing on the washing machine's display.

**Phase 3)**
Some probands react positive on the expiration of the timer, others do not see the notification immediately.
