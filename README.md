## Way of proceeding:
### [Co - Creation:](https://github.com/hhzsmartlab/iowash/tree/master/01_Co-Creation)
Analyze IoT applications in context. Make your application understandable. Use instruments from other lectures, e. g. canvas methods.)

### [Exploration:](https://github.com/hhzsmartlab/iowash/tree/master/02_Exploration)
In a test setup, show how your idea can work. Use IoT Mock-up technology, which you expect to be generally available.

### [Experimentation:](https://github.com/hhzsmartlab/iowash/tree/master/03_Experimentation)
As a result of exploration, determine and justify an MVP of your application. Describe the Living Lab Setup, the users and which data should be collected for the evaluation. A concrete implementation is not necessary.

### [Evaluation:](https://github.com/hhzsmartlab/iowash/tree/master/04_Evaluation)
Describe possible results from the experimental phase and how you can recognize them in the data.
