## Way of proceeding
### [Co - Creation](https://github.com/hhzsmartlab/iowash/tree/master/01_Co-Creation)
To start with we analyze the #iowash application in context. We then make the application understandable by using instruments from other lectures (e. g. canvas methods).

  #### [1.2 List of used methods](https://github.com/hhzsmartlab/iowash/blob/master/01_Co-Creation/1.2_Methods.md)
  
  ##### [1.2.1 Personas](https://github.com/hhzsmartlab/iowash/blob/master/01_Co-Creation/1.2_Methods.md#personas)
  ##### [1.2.2 Value Proposition](https://github.com/hhzsmartlab/iowash/blob/master/01_Co-Creation/1.2_Methods.md#value-proposition)
  ##### [1.2.3 Lean canvas](https://github.com/hhzsmartlab/iowash/blob/master/01_Co-Creation/1.2_Methods.md#lean-canvas)
  ##### [1.2.4 Wheels of Value](https://github.com/hhzsmartlab/iowash/blob/master/01_Co-Creation/1.2_Methods.md#wheels-of-value)
    
### [Exploration](https://github.com/hhzsmartlab/iowash/tree/master/02_Exploration)
In a test setup we show how our idea can work. We use IoT Mock-up technology, which we expect to be generally available.

### [Experimentation](https://github.com/hhzsmartlab/iowash/tree/master/03_Experimentation)
As a result of the exploration phase, we determine and justify an MVP of our application. Furthermore we describe the Living Lab Setup, the users and which data should be collected for the evaluation.

### [Evaluation](https://github.com/hhzsmartlab/iowash/tree/master/04_Evaluation)
Finally, we describe possible results from the experimental phase and how we can recognize them in the data.
